<# Hi, I'm Ensizziyo 👋

I'm an Information Technology student with a strong focus on **Cybersecurity, Cloud Security, and SOC automation**.  
I enjoy building hands-on security projects that demonstrate real-world detection, monitoring, and cloud security concepts.

## 👨‍💻 Project Portfolio

Here are some of the security-focused projects I’ve built and documented on GitHub:

- 🔐 **[Threat Guard – AWS GuardDuty Detection](https://github.com/Vziraka/Threat-Guard-Project)**  
  Simulated a real-world cloud attack scenario and detected credential exfiltration using Amazon GuardDuty.

- 🏠 **[Azure SOC Homelab](https://github.com/Vziraka/Azure-SOC-HomeLab)**  
  Built a cloud-based SOC homelab using Azure Log Analytics to detect failed login attempts and visualize attacker locations.

- 🤖 **[SOC Automation – Splunk + n8n + AI](https://github.com/Vziraka/SOC-automation-project)**  
  Automated SOC alerting using Splunk, n8n, ChatGPT, and Slack for AI-assisted incident triage.

- 🌐 **[AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Security Architecture](#)**  
  Designed a secure AWS VPC with public/private subnets, endpoints, routing, and network security controls. *(In progress)*
